# Time Converter Web App

I developed the Time Converter web app as part of my exploration of JavaScript concepts during the Team Treehouse JavaScript Numbers course. The web apps's primary goal is to convert time units using DaisyUI for styling, Tailwind CSS for layout, and Sweet Alert 2 for enhanced user interactions.

## Overview

The Time Converter web app extends the initial concept of calculating the number of seconds a person has been alive to create a versatile time conversion tool. Key features of the application include:

- Conversion between various time units, including seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.
- Improved user experience through interactive prompts and alerts using Sweet Alert 2.
- Aesthetic design with the help of DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS.

## Usage

1. Access the application at [Time Converter App](https://berianlowe.com/time-converter).
2. Choose the source time unit you want to convert from in the "Convert" dropdown.
3. Select the target time unit you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to initiate the conversion process.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the value to be converted from the chosen source unit.
6. After the calculation, a success alert will display the conversion result.

## Dependencies

The Time Converter Application relies on the following libraries and frameworks:

- [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/): A JavaScript library that enhances user alerts and prompts.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): A CSS framework designed to simplify styling for web interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project's structure includes:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file outlining the webpage structure.
- `css/style.css`: A CSS file responsible for styling, integrating DaisyUI styles.
- `js/maths.js`: A JavaScript file containing the conversion logic, user interactions, and alerts.
